## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

- Hours of availability: Available: check slack availability; blackout period 5-8pm
- Platform used to communicate: Slack, phone, STANDUPS everyday
- How often will take a break: when needed
- Plan for falling behind: blackout Thursday afternoon and night to get everything is all done. Reach out to TA if stuck.

### Cooperative

- Strengths
  - Audrey: back-end and react, googling
  - Mason: coding design (css & scss), back-end and react
- Best utilize these strengths in development of your application: On the same level and check in everyday. Assign features to each other vs one just taking the back-end or front-end
- Develop:
  - Mason: get comfortable calling APIs
  - Audrey: get better at design
- Day to day development: Standups everyday / check in at night

### Conflict Resolution

- One person is pulling all the weight and other not contributing: Discuss during stand ups. Goal is to complete lab
- One person taking over the project: Discuss during stand ups.
- Approach and challenge: Google together, consult with TA's together and network
