## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

- Hours of availability: Available: check slack availability; blackout period 5-8pm
- Platform used to communicate: Slack, phone, STANDUPS everyday
- How often will take a break: when needed
- Plan for falling behind: blackout Thursday afternoon and night to get everything is all done. Reach out to TA if stuck.

### Cooperative

- Strengths
  - Audrey: back-end and react, googling
  - Mason: coding design (css & scss), back-end and react
- Best utilize these strengths in development of your application: On the same level and check in everyday. Assign features to each other vs one just taking the back-end or front-end
- Develop:
  - Mason: get comfortable calling APIs
  - Audrey: get better at design
- Day to day development: Standups everyday / check in at night

### Conflict Resolution

- One person is pulling all the weight and other not contributing: Discuss during stand ups. Goal is to complete lab
- One person taking over the project: Discuss during stand ups.
- Approach and challenge: Google together, consult with TA's together and network
